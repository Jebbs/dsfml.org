                This tutorial outlines how to build DSFML from source. Building
                DSFML produces a set of static libraries which combine the C++
                binding and the D wrapper code. If you plan on using
                <a href="https://code.dlang.org/" title="D's package and build management system.">DUB</a>,
                you don't need to build DSFML directly and can jump to
                <a href="/tutorials/2_4/firstprogram.php">Building Your First DSFML Program</a>.

                <li>A D compiler of your choice</li>
                <li>A C++ compiler - MSVC on Windows or GNU on Linux/OSX</li>

            <h3>build.d</h3>
            <p class="para">
                For convenience, DSFML comes with a build script
                (<code>build.d</code>) to automate the building process. Given
                that you have all the prerequesites listed above, building DSFML
                is mot much more complicated than cloning the DSFML repository
                and running the script.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                To run the script, build it with your D compiler of choice and
                run the produced executable in the top level directory of the
                cloned repository. After completing, you'll see a newly created
                <code>lib</code> directory with static libraries. The build
                script will use the same compilerit was built with to build
                DSFML.
            </p>
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p class="para">
            In the examples below, it is assumed that your D and C++ compilers
            are accessable from the command line. Please be aware that on
            Windows only MSVC is supported as the C++ compiler and the build
            script will default to building x64 libraries.
