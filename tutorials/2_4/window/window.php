                This tutorial only explains how to open and manage a window.
                Drawing stuff is beyond the scope of the dsfml-window module:
                it is handled by the dsfml-graphics module. However, the window
                management remains exactly the same so reading this tutorial is
                important in any case.

                Windows in SFML are defined by the <a class="link" href="/doc/2_4/window/window.php">Window</a>

                construction:

                The above code will open a window, and terminate when the user
                closes it. Let's see how it works in detail.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                First, we added a loop that ensures that the application will be
                refreshed/updated until the window is closed. Most (if not all)
                DSFML programs will have this kind of loop, sometimes called the
                main loop or game loop.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                Then, the first thing that we want to do inside our game loop is
                check for any events that occurred. Note that we use a while
                loop so that all pending events are processed in case there
                were several. The <code class="cl">pollEvent</code> function
                returns <code class="cl">true</code> if an event was pending,
                or <code class="cl">false</code> if there was none.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                Whenever we get an event, we must check its type (window closed?
                key pressed? mouse moved? joystick connected? ...), and react
                accordingly if we are interested in it. In this case, we only
                care about the <p class="para">Event.EventType.Closed</code>
                event, which is triggered when the user wants to close the
                window. At this point, the window is still open and we have to
                close it explicitly with the close function. This enables you to
                do something before the window is closed, such as saving the
                current state of the application, or displaying a message.
            </p>
            <p class="important">
                A mistake that people often make is to forget the event loop,
                simply because they don't yet care about handling events (they
                use real-time inputs instead). Without an event loop, the window
                will become unresponsive. It is important to note that the event
                loop has two roles: in addition to providing events to the user,
                it gives the window a chance to process its internal events too,
                which is required so that it can react to move or resize user
                actions.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                After the window has been closed, the main loop exits and the
                program terminates.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                At this point, you probably noticed that we haven't talked about
                drawing something to the window yet. As stated in the
                introduction, this is not the job of the dsfml-window module,
                and you'll have to jump to the dsfml-graphics tutorials if you
                want to draw things such as sprites, text or shapes.

            <p class="para">
                To draw stuff, you can also use OpenGL directly and totally

                Of course, DSFML allows you to play with your windows a bit.
                Basic window operations such as changing the size, position,
                title or icon are supported, but unlike dedicated GUI libraries
                (Qt, wxWidgets), DSFML doesn't provide advanced features. DSFML
                windows are only meant to provide an environment for OpenGL or

                In case you really need advanced features for your window, you
                can create one (or even a full GUI) with another library, and
                embed DSFML into it. To do so, you can use the other
                constructor, or create function, of <a class="link" href="/doc/2_4/window/window.php">Window</a>
                which takes the OS-specific handle of an existing window. In
                this case, DSFML will create a drawing context inside the given
                window and catch all its events without interfering with the

                its OS-specific handle to implement things that DSFML doesn't
                support.

            <p class="para">
                Sometimes, when your application runs fast, you may notice
                visual artifacts such as tearing. The reason is that your
                application's refresh rate is not synchronized with the vertical
                frequency of the monitor, and as a result, the bottom of the
                previous frame is mixed with the top of the next one.

                The solution to this problem is to activate vertical
                synchronization. It is automatically handled by the graphics
                card, and can easily be switched on and off with the
                <code class="cl">setVerticalSyncEnabled</code> function:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="prettyprint">
window.setVerticalSyncEnabled(true); // call it once, after creating the window</code></pre>

            <p class="para">
                After this call, your application will run at the same frequency
                as the monitor's refresh rate.
            </p>
            <p class="important">
                Sometimes <code>setVerticalSyncEnabled</code> will have no effect: this is
                most likely because vertical synchronization is forced to "off"
                in your graphics driver's settings. It should be set to
                "controlled by application" instead.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                In other situations, you may also want your application to run
                at a given framerate, instead of the monitor's frequency. This
                can be done by calling <code class="cl">setFramerateLimit</code>:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="prettyprint">

                Unlike <code class="cl">setVerticalSyncEnabled</code>, this
                feature is implemented by DSFML itself, using a combination of

                <a class="link" href="/doc/2_4/system/sleep.php">sleep</a>. An
                important consequence is that it is not 100% reliable,
                especially for high framerates: <a class="link" href="/doc/2_4/system/sleep.php">sleep</a>'s
                resolution depends on the underlying operating system and
                hardware, and can be as high as 10 or 15 milliseconds. Don't
                rely on this feature to implement precise timing.

            <p class="important">
                Never use both <code>setVerticalSyncEnabled</code> and

            <p class="para">
                Here is a brief list of what you can and cannot do with SFML windows.
            </p>
            <h3>You can create multiple windows</h3>
            <p class="para">
                DSFML allows you to create multiple windows, and to handle them
                either all in the main thread, or each one in its own thread
                (but... see below). In this case, don't forget to have an event
                loop for each window.
            </p>
            <h3>Multiple monitors are not correctly supported yet</h3>
            <p class="para">
                DSFML doesn't explicitly manage multiple monitors. As a
                consequence, you won't be able to choose which monitor a window
                appears on, and you won't be able to create more than one
                fullscreen window. This should be improved in a future version.
            </p>
            <h3>Events must be polled in the window's thread</h3>
            <p class="para">
                This is an important limitation of most operating systems: the
                event loop (more precisely, the <code class="cl">pollEvent</code>
                or <code class="cl">waitEvent</code> function) must be called in
                the same thread that created the window. This means that if you
                want to create a dedicated thread for event handling, you'll
                have to make sure that the window is created in this thread too.
                If you really want to split things between threads, it is more
                convenient to keep event handling in the main thread and move
                the rest (rendering, physics, logic, ...) to a separate thread
                instead. This configuration will also be compatible with the
                other limitation described below.
            </p>
            <h3>On macOS, windows and events must be managed in the main thread</h3>
            <p class="para">
                Yep, that's true; macOS just won't agree if you try to create a
                window or handle events in a thread other than the main one.
            </p>
            <h3>On Windows, a window which is bigger than the desktop will not behave correctly</h3>

                For some reason, Windows doesn't like windows that are bigger
                than the desktop. This includes windows created with
                <code class="cl">VideoMode.getDesktopMode()</code>: with the
                window decorations (borders and titlebar) added, you end up with
                a window which is slightly bigger than the desktop.
